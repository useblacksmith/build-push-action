# No-Cache Option Verification Report

## Summary
The `no-cache` option is **properly plumbed through** in the `respect-no-cache` branch and will be passed to the Docker buildx command when enabled.

## Code Flow Analysis

### 1. Input Declaration (action.yml:56-59)
```yaml
no-cache:
  description: "Do not use cache when building the image"
  required: false
  default: 'false'
```

### 2. Input Reading (src/context.ts:80)
```typescript
'no-cache': core.getBooleanInput('no-cache')
```
The input is read as a boolean value from GitHub Actions inputs.

### 3. Argument Construction (src/context.ts:273-275)
```typescript
if (inputs['no-cache']) {
  args.push('--no-cache');
}
```
When `no-cache` is true, the `--no-cache` flag is added to the buildx arguments.

### 4. Command Execution (src/main.ts:304-310)
```typescript
const buildCmd = await toolkit.buildx.getCommand(args);
// ...
await Exec.getExecOutput(buildCmd.command, buildCmd.args, ...)
```
The arguments (including `--no-cache` if present) are passed to the buildx command.

## Verification Results

### When `no-cache: true`
- The `--no-cache` flag WILL be added to the docker buildx build command
- BuildKit will not use any cached layers from previous builds
- The entire image will be rebuilt from scratch
- This ensures fresh dependencies and no stale cache issues

### When `no-cache: false` (default)
- The `--no-cache` flag will NOT be added
- BuildKit will use its normal caching behavior
- Cached layers from previous builds will be reused when possible
- This provides faster builds when cache is valid

## Impact on Remote Builder
Since your builder is a custom remote builder that shares BuildKit across various runs:
- With `no-cache: true` - The remote BuildKit instance will ignore all existing cache layers for this specific build
- With `no-cache: false` - The remote BuildKit instance will use its shared cache pool as normal

## Conclusion
The `no-cache` option is correctly implemented and will effectively control whether the remote BuildKit instance uses cached layers. When set to `true`, it forces a complete rebuild without using any cached layers, which is exactly what you'd expect for ensuring fresh builds.
